    "Every worker in the paid group must be paid at least their minimum wage expectation.\n",
    "In the group, each worker's pay must be directly proportional to their quality. This means if a workerâ€™s quality is double that of another worker in the group, then they must be paid twice as much as the other worker.\n",
