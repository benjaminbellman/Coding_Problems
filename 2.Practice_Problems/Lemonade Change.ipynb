    "At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs $5. Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you and order one at a time (in the order specified by bills). Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a $5, $10, or $20 bill. You must provide the correct change to each customer so that the net transaction is that the customer pays $5.\n",

    "From the fourth customer, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5.\n",
    "From the fifth customer, we give a $10 bill and a $5 bill.\n",
