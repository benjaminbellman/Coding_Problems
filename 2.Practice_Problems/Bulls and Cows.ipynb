    "The number of \"bulls\", which are digits in the guess that are in the correct position.\n",
    "The number of \"cows\", which are digits in the guess that are in your secret number but are located in the wrong position. Specifically, the non-bull digits in the guess that could be rearranged such that they become bulls.\n",
