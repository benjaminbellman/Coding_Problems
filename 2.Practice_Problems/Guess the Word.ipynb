    "You are given an array of unique strings words where words[i] is six letters long. One word of words was chosen as a secret word.\n",

    "-1 if word is not from words, or\n",
    "an integer representing the number of exact matches (value and position) of your guess to the secret word.\n",
    "There is a parameter allowedGuesses for each test case where allowedGuesses is the maximum number of times you can call Master.guess(word).\n",

    "master.guess(\"aaaaaa\") returns -1, because \"aaaaaa\" is not in wordlist.\n",
