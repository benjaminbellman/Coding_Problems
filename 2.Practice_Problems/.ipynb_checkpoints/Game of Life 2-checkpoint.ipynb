    "The board is made up of an m x n grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: live (represented by a 1) or dead (represented by a 0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):\n",
    "\n",
    "Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.\n",
    "Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.\n",
    "Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.\n",
    "Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n",
    "The next state of the board is determined by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state of the m x n grid board. In this process, births and deaths occur simultaneously.\n",

    "Given the current state of the board, update the board to reflect its next state.\n",
