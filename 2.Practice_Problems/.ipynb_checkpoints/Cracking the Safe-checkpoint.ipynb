    "There is a safe protected by a password. The password is a sequence of n digits where each digit can be in the range [0, k - 1].\n",
    "\n",
    "The safe has a peculiar way of checking the password. When you enter in a sequence, it checks the most recent n digits that were entered each time you type a digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the correct password is \"345\" and you enter in \"012345\":\n",
    "After typing 0, the most recent 3 digits is \"0\", which is incorrect.\n",
    "After typing 1, the most recent 3 digits is \"01\", which is incorrect.\n",
    "After typing 2, the most recent 3 digits is \"012\", which is incorrect.\n",
    "After typing 3, the most recent 3 digits is \"123\", which is incorrect.\n",
    "After typing 4, the most recent 3 digits is \"234\", which is incorrect.\n",
    "After typing 5, the most recent 3 digits is \"345\", which is correct and the safe unlocks.\n",

    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: n = 1, k = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: \"10\"\n",
    "Explanation: The password is a single digit, so enter each digit. \"01\" would also unlock the safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: n = 2, k = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: \"01100\"\n",
    "Explanation: For each possible password:\n",
    "- \"00\" is typed in starting from the 4th digit.\n",
    "- \"01\" is typed in starting from the 1st digit.\n",
    "- \"10\" is typed in starting from the 3rd digit.\n",
    "- \"11\" is typed in starting from the 2nd digit.\n",
    "Thus \"01100\" will unlock the safe. \"10011\", and \"11001\" would also unlock the safe.\n",
