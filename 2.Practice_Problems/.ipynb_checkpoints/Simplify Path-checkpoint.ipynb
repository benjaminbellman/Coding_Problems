    "Given a string path, which is an absolute path (starting with a slash '/') to a file or directory in a Unix-style file system, convert it to the simplified canonical path.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Unix-style file system, a period '.' refers to the current directory, a double period '..' refers to the directory up a level, and any multiple consecutive slashes (i.e. '//') are treated as a single slash '/'. For this problem, any other format of periods such as '...' are treated as file/directory names.\n",

    "The path starts with a single slash '/'.\n",
    "Any two directories are separated by a single slash '/'.\n",
    "The path does not end with a trailing '/'.\n",
