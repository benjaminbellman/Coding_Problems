    "You are given a string s and an array of strings words. All the strings of words are of the same length.\n",

    "For example, if words = [\"ab\",\"cd\",\"ef\"], then \"abcdef\", \"abefcd\", \"cdabef\", \"cdefab\", \"efabcd\", and \"efcdab\" are all concatenated strings. \"acdbef\" is not a concatenated substring because it is not the concatenation of any permutation of words.\n",

    "Explanation: Since words.length == 4 and words[i].length == 4, the concatenated substring has to be of length 16.\n",
    "There is no substring of length 16 is s that is equal to the concatenation of any permutation of words.\n",
