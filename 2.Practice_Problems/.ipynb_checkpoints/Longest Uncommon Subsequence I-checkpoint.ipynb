    "Given two strings a and b, return the length of the longest uncommon subsequence between a and b. If the longest uncommon subsequence does not exist, return -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "An uncommon subsequence between two strings is a string that is a subsequence of one but not the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "A subsequence of a string s is a string that can be obtained after deleting any number of characters from s.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, \"abc\" is a subsequence of \"aebdc\" because you can delete the underlined characters in \"aebdc\" to get \"abc\". Other subsequences of \"aebdc\" include \"aebdc\", \"aeb\", and \"\" (empty string).\n",

    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: a = \"aba\", b = \"cdc\"\n",

    "Explanation: One longest uncommon subsequence is \"aba\" because \"aba\" is a subsequence of \"aba\" but not \"cdc\".\n",

    "**Example 3:**\n",

    "Input: a = \"aaa\", b = \"aaa\"\n",

    "- 1 <= a.length, b.length <= 100\n",
