    "We are playing the Guessing Game. The game will work as follows:\n",

    "I pick a number between 1 and n.\n",
    "You guess a number.\n",
    "If you guess the right number, you win the game.\n",
    "If you guess the wrong number, then I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower, and you will continue guessing.\n",
    "Every time you guess a wrong number x, you will pay x dollars. If you run out of money, you lose the game.\n",
