    "Alice and Bob play a game with piles of stones. There are an even number of piles arranged in a row, and each pile has a positive integer number of stones piles[i].\n",

    "If Bob takes the last 5, then the board is [3, 4], and Alice takes 4 to win with 9 points.\n",
    "This demonstrated that taking the first 5 was a winning move for Alice, so we return true.\n",
