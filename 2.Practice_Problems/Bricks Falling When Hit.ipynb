    "You are given an m x n binary grid, where each 1 represents a brick and 0 represents an empty space. A brick is stable if:\n",

The brick on that location (if it exists) will disappear. Some other bricks may no longer be stable because of that erasure and will fall. Once a brick falls, it is immediately erased from the grid (i.e., it does not land on other stable bricks).\n",
